# Software Testing and Validation

For this project we were given a system's description and a set of class interfaces (with no implementation), and then were tasked with specifying:
- Class scope test cases for the Client class;
- Class scope test cases for the Terminal class;
- Method scope test cases for the computeCost() method of the Communication class;
- Method scope test cases for the removeTerminal() method of the Client class;
- Additionally, implementing 8 test cases (4 success and 4 failure test cases) from the test suite designed to exercise the Client class at class scope using the TestNG testing framework.

In other words, the Java code in this project was made without much thought and attention, mostly to be used as general guidance for the project's actual goal, which was to specify the test cases present on the [report](https://github.com/TiDeane/TVS_IST/blob/main/proj-28.pdf).
